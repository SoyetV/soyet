                        <h1>Computer Hardware</h1>
                        <p>It refers to the physical components that a computer system requires to function or the physical elements that comprise a computer system.</p>
                        <p>It includes the physical parts or components of a computer, such as the case, Central Processing Unit, monitor, mouse, keyboard, computer storage (e.g., hard disk drive), memory, graphics card, sound card, printers, speakers, motherboard, and others.</p>
                        <p>It refers to the physical, tangible computer equipment and devices, which provide support for major functions such as input, processing (internal storage, computation and control), output, secondary storage (for data and programs), and communication.</p>
                        
                        <h2>Notes:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Computer Hardware</strong> is a collective term used to describe any of the physical components of an analog or digital computer.</li>
                            <li>The term hardware distinguishes the tangible aspects of a computing device from software (which consists of written instructions that tell physical components what to do).</li>
                            <li>All of which are physical objects that you can actually touch.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                        <h2>Types of Computers or Computer Systems</h2>
                    
                        <h3>Supercomputers</h3>
                        <p>The fastest and the most expensive computers. These huge computers are used to solve very complex science and engineering problems. They get their processing power by taking advantage of parallel processing; they use lots of CPUs at the same time on one problem. A typical supercomputer can do up to ten trillion individual calculations every second.</p>

                        <p>These are computers that are similar to supercomputers in many aspects, the main difference between them is the fact that a supercomputer uses all its raw power to focus on very few tasks, while the purpose of a mainframe is to perform thousands or millions of operations concurrently.</p>
                        <p>They are often employed by large organizations for bulk data processing, such as census, industry and consumer statistics, enterprise resource planning, and transaction processing.</p>

                        <p>These are computers that are smaller, less expensive, and less powerful than a mainframe or supercomputer, but more expensive and more powerful than a personal computer.</p>
                        <p>They are small and inexpensive computers that do the same tasks as a mainframe computer with limited extent. They are a type of server that can support computer networks and enable users to share files, software, and other resources.</p>

                        <h3>Server Computer</h3>
                        <p>It refers to a central computer that contains collections of data and programs. It is a computer that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.</p>
                    
                        <h3>Workstations</h3>
