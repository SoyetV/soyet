                        <h2>Computing</h2>
    <p>It refers to a goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or associated with the creation and use of computers. It includes a variety of interpretations such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Designing and constructing hardware and software systems for a wide range of purposes</li>
        <li>Processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information</li>
        <li>Doing scientific studies using computers</li>
        <li>Problem-solving by finding solutions to problems or proving a solution does not exist</li>
        <li>Making computer systems behave intelligently</li>
        <li>Creating and using communications and entertainment media</li>
        <li>Finding and gathering information relevant to any particular purpose</li>
        <li>Many others (the list is virtually endless, and the possibilities are vast)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It also has other meanings that are more specific, based on the context in which the term is used.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> An information systems specialist will view computing somewhat differently from a software engineer.</p>
    <p>Regardless of the context, doing computing well can be complicated and difficult. Because society needs people to do computing well, we must think of computing not only as a profession but also as a discipline.</p>
    <p>A student typically earns a bachelor’s degree in one of the computing disciplines to prepare for entry into the computing profession. Because computing provides such a wide range of choices, it is impossible for anyone to become proficient at all of them. Hence, an individual who wishes to become a computing professional requires some focus for his or her professional life.</p>
    <p>There are currently five major kinds of undergraduate degree programs in computing, and each one provides a different focus and perspective on the discipline of computing.</p>

    <h3>Computing: A Family of Disciplines</h3>
    <p><strong>Pre-1990s:</strong> Computer science was on the technical side, and information systems were on the business side.</p>
    <p><strong>During the 1990s:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Computer engineering became a strong discipline</li>
        <li>Software engineering was sometimes thought of as an area within computer science but began its own identity</li>
        <li>Information technology programs were common worldwide but began emerging in the 1990s</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Computing Disciplines & Majors</h3>
    <p>Following are the five main computing disciplines, their focus, and the kinds of problems and issues they address:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Computer Engineering:</strong> Typically involves software and hardware and the development of systems that involve software, hardware, and communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Currently the most popular of the computing disciplines; tends to be relatively broad and with an emphasis on the underlying science aspects.</li>
        <li><strong>Information Systems:</strong> Essentially, this is computing in an organizational context, typically in businesses.</li>
        <li><strong>Information Technology:</strong> Focuses on computing infrastructure and the needs of individual users, involving systems for various purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Software Engineering:</strong> Focuses on large-scale software systems and employs engineering principles for building reliable software systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Body of Knowledge</h3>
    <p><img src="images/body-of-knowledge.png" alt="Body of knowledge"></p>

    <h3>Growing Diversity in Computing</h3>
    <p>The following framework will be used to sketch out the conceptual territory occupied by each of the five computing disciplines. These are informal illustrations used to communicate the task force’s subjective interpretation of the various disciplines. They are not based on any precise quantitative foundation. Furthermore, they show only computing topics. Both computer engineering and information systems programs devote significant attention to topics that are outside of computing and not reflected in this diagram.</p>

    <div class="discipline-section">
        <h3>Computer Engineering</h3>
        <p>Computer engineering covers the range from theory and principles to the practical applications of designing and implementing products using hardware and software. It narrows towards the center as we move upwards because a computer engineer’s interests narrow as we move away from the hardware. By the time we get up to the level of software development, we see that the computer engineer’s interest has narrowed to the horizontal center because they care about software only inasmuch as they need it to develop integrated devices.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="discipline-section">
        <h3>Computer Science</h3>
        <p>Computer science covers most of the vertical space between the extreme top and bottom because computer scientists generally do not deal with just the hardware that runs software or the organization that makes use of the information computing provides. They design and develop all types of software from systems infrastructure to application technologies. However, computer scientists do not typically manage the deployment of these systems.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="discipline-section">
        <h3>Information Systems</h3>
        <p>Information systems professionals are concerned with the relationship between information systems and the organizations they serve. Their role includes system deployment, configuration, and training of users. IS professionals often tailor application technologies to meet enterprise needs, sometimes developing systems that utilize other software products to suit their organizations’ information needs.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="discipline-section">
        <h3>Information Technology</h3>
        <p>Information technology focuses on application, deployment, and configuration needs across a wide spectrum. IT people often develop web-enabled digital technologies and create foundations in relevant principles and theory. IT is still a new discipline, and its focus has been on educational programs that give students a foundation in existing concepts and skills.</p>
        <p><img src="images/IT Graph.PNG" alt="IT graph"></p>
    </div>

    <div class="discipline-section">
        <h3>Software Engineering</h3>
        <p>Software engineering covers a wide range of needs in large-project software expertise. Its main goal is to develop systematic models and reliable techniques for producing high-quality software on time and within budget. SE’s domain extends from theory and principles to robust systems infrastructure and organizational information systems.</p>
